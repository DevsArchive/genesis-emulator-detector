## Sega Genesis Emulator Detector

This is my emulator detector for the Sega Genesis that I made back in 2019. It can detect multiple emulators and check if it's being run on actual hardware. I made this primarily as an exercise in programming and researching emulators, but it has helped a few emulator developers iron out some kinks to make them more accurate.

As the way things stand right now, I have no interest in maintaining this, so with emulators that are actively being developed, this can be obsolete. I am sure there are plenty of other tests that can be done, though.

Detects:
* Kega Fusion
* Regen
* Genesis Plus GX
* Gens
* Exodus
* Picodrive
* Genecyst
* AtGames Flashback
* AtGames Firecore
* Sega's Steam emulator
* Mega Sg (Old versions)
* BlastEm (Old versions)

Special thanks to BigEvilCorporation for the AtGames detection code.
